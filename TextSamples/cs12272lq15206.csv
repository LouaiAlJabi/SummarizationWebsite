I like how you tested not just the number of Simploids that got sick, but also checked their blood toxicity levels! Even though it appears the Simploids cannot die or get sick from the herbicide in 4 weeks, it is clear that the herbicide is negatively affecting them in some way, which could lead to another hypothesis and experiment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. how many weeks: I ran this experiment for a total of 4 weeks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d. how many replicates: I had a total of 8 plots for my experiment. Plots 1-4 had parasites on them and plots 5-8 were non-parasitic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to do my experiment on parasites because the lawns with parasites seemed to have higher effects on the simploids getting sick and dying. I made sure that half of my plots included plants with parasites and the other half with no parasites. This ensured replication and that my hypothesis would be better represented. I ran this experiment for 4 weeks because we were told in the lab that was how long it took 4 weeks for the sickness to incubate and for the simploids to be effected.&lt;/p&gt;

I kept the number of plants, Simploids the same throughout all plots. This ensured&nbsp;replication and a greater amount of accuracy. I ran the experiment for 4 weeks.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then created one graph charting both the % of Simploid death and the % of Simploid sickness. To do this, I plotted the percent effected (plots 1-4) on the y-axis and the number of weeks on the x-axis. I excluded the control groups (plots 5-8) because the number of sicknesses and the number of deaths was 0. On the side, I made a key for the color-coded variables.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this experiment, I conducted a trial across four weeks to test the effects that the parasitic shamworm presense had on overall Simploid health. I utilized eight plots total, with four as my controls which contained zero parasitic presence. The other four plots all contained parasites and had consistent numbers of simploids and plants across. This consistency was also included within the controls. The data was represented in a bar graph, with the x-axis independent variable containing the range of weeks in which the experiment was conducted and the y-axis containing the number of simploids that were effected. Overall, the data supports the hypothesis that parasitic presence cause simploids to get sick.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to test for&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;parasites&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;in my first experiment. I did not want to needlessly waste the resources of the city of Idyllic, so I used only four plots to conduct the experiment. I used 30 Simploids and gave them 40 plants for each plot, so food sources would not be a confounding factor. Two of the plots contained parasites (as my experimental group), while the two other plots did not (control group). After four weeks of trial, I found that, on average, 66.5% of my Simploids got sick (SD of 3.5%). Only one parasite-ridden plot had dead Simploids, but for consistency, I averaged it as well and got an average death rate of 3.5% (SD of 3.5% as well). We can then conclude that parasites did have a negative effect on the Simploid&#039;s health, but not necessarily on the death rate.&lt;/p&gt;

330014,12272,15206,19940,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;My hypothesis was that the parasites were making the simploids sick. To test this, I created a control group of 40 simploids&nbsp;with no herbicides, no parasites, and 40 plants in the plot, and an experimental group of 40 simploids with no herbicides, parasites present, and 40 plants in the plot. There were 3 replicates, so there were three plots for both the control and the experimental conditions. I ran the experiment for 4 weeks, looking at the percentage of simploids in each plot that fell sick. For the graph, I averaged the replicates together for the control and experimental conditions. This data supports the hypothesis that parasites are making the simploids sick, as the control groups had no sick simploids after four weeks, while the experimental groups had more than 50% of the simploids fall ill. Note: the decrease in the percentage of sick simploids in week 3 is because some simploids died that week.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
