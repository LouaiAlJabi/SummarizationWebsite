697502,19340,22725,33919,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;The article, &quot;The Little Things that Run the World,&quot; emphasizes the abundance of small invertebrates as proven by their sheer combined body mass. Wilson claims that invertebrates are the foundation of life, and are essential to our ecosystems. I feel that this is true to a certain degree, as there are so many invertebrates on Earth that they must have some impact on their community. Those invertebrates that are primary producers would have even more of a profound impact on their respective communities, I believe.&nbsp;These ideas resemble&nbsp;bottom up control, in which the lower trophic levels, in this case the invertebrates, determine the structure and function of the higher tropic levels. The article, &quot;The Big Things that Run the World,&quot; Terbough&nbsp;claims that top predators hold the key to stability of the diversity of plants and animals below them. These top predators indirectly affect the levels below them, as demonstrated in a study where the top carnivores were removed, resulting in a dramatic increase in the amount of predators below them. This is resembling of a top down control, where the higher tropic levels determines the structure and function of the lower trophic levels through predation. I agree more with Terbough on this, as I feel that removing top predators would have a much larger impact than removing invertebrates from the community. However, the importance of the big and little things may also depend on the specific community and the interactions within it.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

697525,19340,22725,33984,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The Little Things That Run the World&rdquo; by Edward O. Wilson provided a new outlook on invertebrate importance and their impact on environmental stability. I was shocked to discover that 90% of Earth&#039;s biodiversity stems from invertebrates, considering the lack of consideration towards these influential organisms. As opposed to our constant distinction between vertebrate species, we overlook the various invertebrate taxonomies and clump them into one vague, overarching classification. We fail to acknowledge how pivotal these small but mighty organisms are to the stability of nature. Should their immense biomass diminish, the Earth would simply &quot;rot&quot; (Wilson 345). Mechanisms such as returning nutrients to plants to maintain the stability of tropical forests are crucial to maintaining our ecosystems. This resembles the bottom-up hypothesis, where the links lower on the food chain determine the structure and function of the entire ecosystem. Considering that the stability of our world is dependent upon these organisms, I believe that their observation and examination should be met with ample gravitas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &ldquo;The Big Things That Run the World&rdquo; by John Terborgh provides a contrasting outlook on this perspective. He, instead, suggests that it is larger animals that ecologists fail to recognize and monitor for their impacts on the ecosystem. Because of their higher levels on the food chain, Terborgh believes they hold the key to ecosystem stability and the maintenance of biodiversity. This reminded me of our in-class discussion on trophic cascades and the influences of top-down interactions, where these larger predators determine the flow of natural resources and energy throughout all trophic levels. Altering a predator&rsquo;s ability to capture prey or fecundity directly and indirectly impacts vertebrates, invertebrates, and primary producers. Nevertheless, I stand with Wilson&rsquo;s point of view that it is the invertebrates that require more attention and inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

I found it surprising that the disappearance of humans would have little to no effect on the life of invertebrates whereas human life and most other vertebrate species wouldn&#039;t persist in the absence of invertebrates. It is critical that as humans we are aware of our potential to either conserve or destroy invertebrate species. We must take initiative to preserve invertebrate species as they are of the utmost importance to the planet and everything that lives on it. On the contrary, in the article titled &ldquo;The Big Things That Run the World&rdquo;, the author points out the impact from a top down perspective claiming that predators at the top of the food chain should be accredited with the success of other species in the world, not the other way around. Evidence is present that predators at the top of the chain have direct and indirect effects on the species below it all the way down to the primary producers. It is interesting to learn about both of these perspectives and how invertebrates and vertebrates coexist in environments. After reading the two articles, I have a new appreciation for the small critters on the planet and will try to be more conscious of their presence.

For this reason, invertebrate conservation is practicable and inexpensive. I think it&#039;s intriguing that the ex-situ&nbsp;preservation&nbsp;of invertebrate species is pretty frugal.

Although smaller organisms play a part in maintaining our ecosystems, the top predators affect other organisms within them more significantly. Similar to how we saw the trophic cascades in the case of wolves in Yellowstone, predator and prey biomass is altered extensively when vertebrate predators are extracted. Similarly, when placed back into the community, interactions between the organisms are altered and may increase or decrease population size. So while it is invertebrates that keep the ecosystem surviving, it is the vertebrates that maintain the levels below them.&lt;/p&gt;

697787,19340,22725,33935,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;After reading the articles on little and big things that run the world I have seen two differing opinions on vertebrates and invertebrates on earth. To start off, I was suprised to see there are more invertebrates than vertebrates on earth. Invertebrates are extremely diverse, with over 30 million on earth (these are most beetles). Invertebrate niches can be small due to their small body mass. It was surprising to read that we, as humans, need invertebrates to survive, but they don&#039;t need us. We could not survive a few months without invertebrates. Because of this, I agree that we need to focus on conservation and preservation of small invertebrates and plant species. Next, I read about big things or vertebrates. Big things sometimes are neglected because they are bulky and hard to study. They are hard to study due to the fact they are difficult to capture, observe, and mark. Due to this, the author believes big things are underappreciated. Predators have a big impact on vertebrate communities, with increased predators in vertebrae areas, there are sometimes more than the environment can sustain. This causes prey species to be severely decreased. The Lotka- Volterra competition, that we discussed in the Community Dynamics unit, shows how competition influences the abundance of two competing species. This article discussed how if there are more predators, this affects vertebrate species dramatically. Big things are also very vulnerable to hunting and fragmented landscapes. These things could lead to erosion of diversity of the species. I believe both small and big species are important and Biodiversity of all animals plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth. They are vital for both the environment and for humans.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Something that really stood out to me in this article is when Wilson said, &quot; If human beings were not so impressed by size alone, they would consider an ant more wonderful than a rhinoceros&quot;. This stood out to me because what initially sparked my interest in biology and ecology wasn&#039;t vertebrates, it was the fact that there are thousands of tiny individuals, many of which posses complex ecologies,&nbsp;participating and supporting the world around us. I&#039;m very happy to hear that there are major conservation and education efforts in&nbsp;effect for invertebrate species, because humans and the rest of the natural world cannot survive without them. I wasn&#039;t really surprised about the&nbsp;fact that humans can&#039;t survive without invertebrates because for years now I&#039;ve been hearing and seeing the &quot;save the bees&quot; slogan very frequently. One of the main reasonings behind the Save the Bees Foundation is that humans cannot function without bees. Honeybees alone pollinate 80% of all flowering plants in the United States and their numbers were decline for quite some time. Without this invertebrate, many people and ecosystems would suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

Larger predatory invertebrates include the giant squid, and the lions mane jellyfish. These species can also be involved in top down control. So I think it&#039;s safe to say that both &#039;the little things&quot; and &quot;the big things&quot; are equally as important in the natural world. In some certain ecosystems one may be more important than the other but they all depend on each other and I think that it&#039;s important advocate for both when it comes to research and conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

Top predators maintain ecosystem stability via the indirect effects of hierarchy on balance and increased species diversity.

They both act as keystones but with different methods of trophic regulation. It feels similar to the nature vs. nurture debate, where it is necessary to utilize the integration of both concepts, rather than as separate entities, for better overall understanding. We need to consider how the massive percentage of invertebrates serve our ecosystems despite how underrepresented they may be. The same goes for top predators; they serve as top-down ecosystem regulators who are also underrepresented but for inverse reasons. Invertebrates and apex predators hold a considerable amount of weight on environmental balance and should not be excluded from the greater conversation around their importance within ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, learning that invertebrates&nbsp;were the highest consumers of plants in most ecosystems was interesting since that also made me think of trophic levels and how vertebrates are often pictured as the herbivores, this could also be like the grazer food chain if top predators aren&#039;t included. Thinking about how much mass that herbivores eat in plants everyday also made me think about the concept that energy transfer is inefficient, so they require a lot of food.&nbsp;The article also says that invertebrates are essential for us, but they don&#039;t need us, this made me think of some potential bottom-up influences of invertebrates on the trophic levels above them. Terborgh&#039;s article &quot;The Big things that run the world&quot; was also interesting to me as it emphasized the importance of some top predators in the ecosystem rather than the small herbivores and invertebrates.

698475,19340,22725,34060,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;The article, &quot;The Little Things That Run the World,&quot; by Edward O. Wilson, highlights the importance of invertebrates in maintaining ecosystems, challenging the common perception that larger vertebrates dominate environmental processes. I think this is true because without small invertebrates taking care of the ecosystem, there wouldn&#039;t be a livable environment for large vertebrates. Wilson then explores the diversity and abundance of invertebrates, emphasizing their role in the nutrient cycle, decomposition, and ecological balance. The article states that invertebrates, especially ants and termites, are crucial for the health of tropical forests and other habitats. Wilson advocates for increased conservation efforts focused on invertebrates, recognizing their vulnerability to human activities. This is also true because humans are known for destroying habitats for economical-benefit or self-benefit. I think it&#039;s good that he&#039;s spreading knowledge about this, urging for less destructive practices to these habitats.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the &quot;Big Things That Run the World&quot; article by John Terborgh, provides a counterpoint, emphasizing the ecological importance of larger vertebrates such as jaguars, pumas, and elephants. Terborgh argues that these &quot;big things&quot; play a pivotal role in shaping ecosystems through predation and indirect effects on plant populations. I think this is the more reasonable and better article. While smaller invertebrates provide stability in the environment, larger vertebrates impact ecosystem balance among the food chain. This idea is exactly what we&#039;re currently learning with the S3 Community Dynamics. Large species are vital for an ecosystem equilibrium. Without predators keeping the ecosystem in check, everything would collapse. Terborgh&nbsp;then explains that the absence of top predators can lead to cascading effects, impacting the abundance of smaller vertebrates and even influencing tree species composition. Thus, making top predators the most important, impactful, species in the environment.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two articles are basically discussing &quot;bottom-up&quot; and &quot;top-down&quot; effects. The first article discusses the importance of small invertebrates and how they maintain nutrients in the soil, which is the &quot;bottom-up&quot; effect.

Lower predators are indirectly affected by apex predators.&nbsp;In a study where&nbsp;top carnivores were eliminated, predators below them increased dramatically.

They have a huge impact on our world and just because we can&#039;t see their effect directly, we can&#039;t forget about them, or disregard them as important beings to how our world functions. It&#039;s&nbsp;interesting to think about these seemingly insignificant creatures as being so vital to our survival and as substantial part of our globe, being 90% of all biomass. I have been learning a lot about ants recently (don&#039;t ask) and through that I have realized just how incredible these little creatures are. They can carry 100x their weight and form complex colonies and structures. they can use tools and even farm! Leaf cutter ants don&#039;t actually eat the leaves like I thought but instead they take the leaves back to their colony and use it to farm a fungus that grows on decaying leaves and then they eat that! I think this article just goes to show that there&#039;s a lot more to tiny things than we realize.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second article, &quot;The big things that run the world&quot;, Terborgh takes a different perspective. He says the bigger organisms are the ones that have the biggest impact on the ecosystem. He argues that removing the bigger organisms will have a greater impact on an ecosystem because without them, all of the trophic levels below them will be all out of balance. This reminds me of the wolves in Yellowstone that we learned about. When farmers removed the wolves because they were a pest to their sheep, the elk were able to roam freely and eat all the aspen, disrupting the birds and other creatures that lived in the aspen forests. Without the wolves there to control the elk population, the whole ecosystem was out of balance. This supports Terborgh&#039;s argument.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think both articles bring up good points about balance in an ecosystem. In my opinion, the most logical conclusion is that both are correct in some respect. I think all organisms fill a role in an ecosystem so removing any one organism is going to have an effect. All organisms are equally important to sustaining an ecosystem.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The world of small biology is a complex soup of ingredients that needs to be just right, and what I argue here is that although large biology may also be a complex and structurally important web, I cannot imagine that most ecosystems at the large animal scale outcompete the systems at the small scale for importance in the overall productivity of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

The fact that there is a larger possibility of niches must result in more species. I had never thought of it this way and I was fascinated to learn just how much of the biomass the invertebrates make up. Apparently, there are 30 times more species of invertebrates than vertebrates. This number blows my mind because it seems like everywhere you look in nature there is a different type of vertebrate.

It is weird to see that life can arise from such odd places. It was also very curious to learn about the concept of indirect effects.

Wilson, are engaging pieces that play off each other. From &lt;em&gt;The Little Things,&lt;/em&gt; I was surprised to learn about the weight of invertebrates on the species of the world. The sheer size, population, and diversity of the class is awe-inspiring. What stuck with me through this article was a sentence written on page 345 by Wilson &ndash; that if we rely on invertebrates but they don&rsquo;t need us. Their support of the natural world around us and the role they play is relied on by an unfathomable number of other species. Conversely, the &lt;em&gt;Big Things&lt;/em&gt; paper is like a rebuttal in my mind. Terborgh makes a point that the &lsquo;big things&rsquo; are important, too. And not only are they important, they&rsquo;re vulnerable. Personally, I side with the Little Things argument because, as we know, the predator typically follows prey cycles, as the lower trophic levels are incredibly important to the longevity of those above it. Both readings represent a key concept from S3 of Community Dynamics and discussion in class. The little things argument is most close to a bottom-up control model, while the big things paper is keen to top-down control in natural systems.&lt;/p&gt;

He also talked about the power they hold as primary consumers and how, without humans and other vertebrates, these seemingly insignificant creatures can thrive and heal the Earth at large. In stark contrast to the wide brush Dr. Wilson paints all vertebrates and other flora and fauna with, going so far as to imply they are detrimental and unnecessary, Dr. Terborgh talks about the fact that not only are vertebrates and other larger fauna are just as important as their invertebrate counterparts, but that they are the ones who control the ecosystem. Terborgh further proves his point by explaining that these larger food-chain inhabitants are the reason population control exists and that with population control, they inherently aide in the conservation of many different species, including many invertebrates. Both articles show proof that every part of the ecosystem has a role to play in energy transfers based on how they are needed for consumption or to be consumed by others on the food chain.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Wilson&#039;s article, &quot;The Little Things that Run the World&quot;, he talks about the shear magnitude and density of invertebrates that make up ecosystems all across the world. At first it was hard for me to wrap my head around how many invertebrates there are, especially in a single hectare in the amazon rainforest. A couple dozen birds and mammals compared to over a billion invertebrates in such a relatively small sample area. The more I think about it, it really does make sense that invertebrates would have such a massive impact on the ecosystems they are a part of, even if solely based on the combined mass. Invertebrates are very important and offer a lot to their ecosystems through the bottom up frame of thought. They control much of what goes on in an ecosystem and act as a building block for every other living thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In John Terborgh&#039;s article, &quot;The Big Things that Run the World&quot;, he mentions the idea of a more top down approach to the ecosystems. Talking about how jaguars, top predator of the ecosystems he had studied, were able to control and influence the structure of the entire ecosystem. The idea of a trophic cascade and as the jaguar continues to hunt down its prey it affects everything beneath it.

Researchers should investigate the large apex predators more, as they help determine food chain length in top-down food chains. Many insects talked about in Wilson&#039;s article may have not existed if not for the top predators of the world. Invertebrates are without a doubt, very important to many ecosystems but this should not be a reason to not research the bigger animals.&nbsp;Without the apex predators, many low-fecundity prey will suffer losses very heavily, as their resources get taken over by the high-fecundity prey that are striving without the predator. While having a lot of diversity in small invertebrates is obviously a good thing, I believe nowadays it is a bigger concern for apex predators as many are on the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

I think oftentimes invertebrates go unnoticed compared to invertebrates, so reading this article and realizing how crucial invertebrates are was special. Invertebrates tend to be classified into one category, taking away how powerful and paramount these little organisms are to their environments. The role of invertebrates can be equated to the bottom-up hypothesis because the organisms that are found lower down in the food chain (invertebrates) affect the whole stability and function of the organisms that are higher up in the food chain. This, in turn, affects the whole ecosystem, and without the presence of the invertebrates, many ecosystems would fail to thrive. On the other hand, &quot;The Big Things that Run the World&quot; is the other perspective regarding larger animals and their effect on their ecosystems. The author points out that the larger animals in the food chain, animals that would be found higher up&nbsp;in the food chain perhaps, have more of an effect on the stability and function of the ecosystem. This can be tied back to the top-down hypothesis that we&#039;ve gone over in class, which basically states that larger animals in the food chain determine how the ecosystem functions. Overall, I think I agree more with the first article in saying that invertebrates and the more overlooked parts of the food chain determine the outcome of an ecosystem. Without the invertebrates, there&#039;s a chance the larger animals wouldn&#039;t even be around, and everything in the ecosystem would be thrown out of balance.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The author claims that due to many factors such as total biomass, the effect they have on shaping their environments, and the immense diversity of invertebrates, they are of greater importance than vertebrates in many ecosystems. Similarly to S3 Community Dynamics, it is abundantly clear that this author believes bottom-up control has the greatest impact on ecological communities. More specifically, how many vertebrates are dominant&nbsp;as a species, despite being so small, and have a proportionally large impact on other tropic levels.&nbsp;However, this article also demonstrates the top-down control of these invertebrates. Lastly, this article stresses the importance of preserving invertebrates just as we do with larger vertebrates. The author stresses the notion that this would be an easy task as a mere 10ha would be able to sustain multiple invertebrate species indefinitely.&nbsp;In contrast, the article &quot;The Big Things that Run the World&quot; aims to dispute the claim that invertebrates have the biggest impact on communities. The author of this article states that many large herbivores and predators are often not studied as it is&nbsp;difficult to observe the effects they have on community dynamics. Unlike the previous article, the importance of top-down control is strongly emphasized. Its importance is shown by analyzing an ecosystem in which natural predators of a few herbivores are absent and the effect it has on the foliage of the island. Without larger organisms that control the herbivore population, specifically the granivore (seed predators), the plant population has suffered a major impact. This is exactly where top-down control comes into play and demonstrates the importance of individuals in higher trophic levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

I have to disagree with this statement because although I do think that these predators contribute to a smooth-running ecosystem by consuming prey and regulating their population, the prey that these predators are eating relies on the vegetation within the ecosystem. Typically the invertebrates have a more direct effect on the vegetation of ecosystems than the predators do.&nbsp;Without these small creatures, the prey that the predators eat will lose their food source which will cause an eventual extinction, therefore the predators will also lose their food source.&lt;/p&gt;

Big species are essential to the balance of an ecosystem. Everything would collapse if there were no predators to maintain the balance of the ecosystem. A lack of apex predators can have a domino effect on the quantity of lower vertebrates and even the species makeup of trees.

As tiny, miniscule things, we tend not to think of them very much. However, Wilson maintains that their ubiquity is a prominent feature of our environment, and that without them, we would not survive the inevitable collapse of the diverse interactions and cycles that invertebrates are the root of. In &ldquo;The Big Things that Run the World,&rdquo; John Terborgh offers a different perspective. He argues that the bigger vertebrate species, such as elephants and jaguars, are underappreciated and understudied despite providing great insight into ecological interactions. I think both of these authors make great points. When interpreting community dynamics, you must look at the whole picture and how different aspects affect one another. As we have seen in class, trophic levels are greatly impacted by each other &ndash; without the presence of top predators such as Terborgh&rsquo;s jaguars, lower trophic levels would go unchecked, cascading further down until finally reaching producers. Without invertebrates, higher trophic levels would be disrupted and the stability of the ecosystem as a whole would diminish. These top-down and bottom-up effects are not mutually exclusive in the complex matrix of community dynamics; they both exhibit highly important interactions between trophic levels that can influence the function of various ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

I was not surprised&nbsp;to learn that the absence of humans would have minimal impact on invertebrates despite their absence having a significant impact on us.&nbsp;Recognizing our potential to either conserve or harm invertebrate species is crucial for us as humans. We need to take proactive steps to protect these species, considering their utmost importance to the planet and its entire ecosystem. On the contrary, the article &quot;The Big Things That Run the World&quot; argues from a top-down perspective, suggesting that predators at the apex of the food chain should be credited for the success of other species, not the other way around. Evidence supports the idea that top predators have direct and indirect effects on species throughout the food chain, reaching down to primary producers. Exploring these perspectives on the coexistence of invertebrates and vertebrates in environments is intriguing. Having read both articles, I&#039;ve developed a greater appreciation for the smaller organisms on the planet and will make an effort to be more mindful of their presence. While Terborgh covers essential aspects of large creatures on Earth, it&#039;s worth noting that historically, these larger organisms have received more attention from the scientific community than invertebrates have.&lt;/p&gt;

This article takes a bottom up approach to the discussion of trophic levels, stating that larger vertebrates (such as humans) would not be able to survive without invertebrates, but that they would be fine without us. I found the section about leafcutter&nbsp;ants especially interesting. I had no idea that they have a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi! The two authors seem to have similar ideas about the importance of research and awareness about biodiversity. In the second article, however, there is more of a top-down perspective on trophic levels. &quot;The Big Things That Run The World&quot; emphasizes the &quot;stabilizing&quot; function of bigger (especially carnivorous) predators, and how they work to level out the trophic level below them. With plant predator populations then stabilized, plants can produce enough seeds (and not have them eaten) to survive into the next year. I believe that both articles contain elements of correctness&nbsp;- every trophic level is important, and every ecosystem is evolved to sustain itself with all of the creatures and levels it contains. I do agree with Edward O. Wilson, who authored the first article, that small invertebrates are under studied and under appreciated. Trophic cascades, which are indirectly spoken of in the second article by John Terbough, are also important to consider, as evidenced by the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone.

Wilsons puts into perspective just how important invertebrates are by referring to them as the foundation of all life for our ecosystem. I initially was not sure how to feel about this, as I admittingly have always first considered vertebrates when thinking about the natural order of our ecosystem. However, further reading challenged my previous beliefs after realizing just how much space they take up and just how important they truly are for regulating ecosystems. This particular article reminded me of our SimuText readings pertaining to bottom-up control. Bottom-up control differs from the top-down approach, as the bottom-up approach does not control the ecosystem through predator control but rather the amount of resources - and lower trophic levels influence the dynamics of higher trophic levels. The second article, &ldquo;The Big Things That Run the World&rdquo;, took a fairly different approach, in which Terbough chose to focus more on the concept of top-down approach. Terbough argued that the higher trophic levels, or predators, indirectly influence ecosystems to a higher extent than what the invertebrates directly influence the ecosystem. I do partially agree with Terbough, as I think predators are essential to providing &ldquo;checks and balances&rdquo; to an ecosystem. I definitely agree with both Wilson and Terbough that both small and big things play a crucial role in the community; however, which one is more important is entirely dependent on the functionality of their particular ecosystem/community.&lt;/p&gt;

In balancing an ecosystem the invertebrates convert dead vegetation into nutrients for the plants. These plants are food resources for other animals, which those animals are prey of another animal and so on. If&nbsp;the invertebrates were unable to convert the energy for the plants, everything following down the chain would be impacted. As for the big things, predation makes sense to be their primary impact. Every environment has species with specific carrying capacities, and in order to keep the environment stable the predator prey dynamic must persist. I did find it interesting though how predation affects diversity. Through direct and indirect effects, the big things keep population sizes stable for all species so that they exist in that environment. If the big things were disrupted, the animals and plants below them would grow way over the carrying capacity they can hold and it would disrupt the stability of the environment as a whole/ diminishing diversity. Overall, both the little things and the big things play different roles in the community, but they both work to maintain the diversity and stability of said environments. If either ceased to exist, there would be major implications that would ultimately lead to extinction and less diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

Herbivores, like beetles and soldier ants, consume a lot of floiage, with an ant colony of 2 million need 50kgs a day to continue to feed the population. While this isnt a direct &quot;bottom up&quot;, which usually starts on the first trophic levels with producers, the activity of the ants may affect the trophic levels above them by removing plants that other herbivores may eat, like deer.

This really resonates with the bottom-up control, with the main source of energy not even coming from primarily from producers, but from the incredibly small primary consumers, micro-invertebrates, and then secondary macro-invertebrates. Wilson&#039;s point of view on conservation of invertebrates is completely sensical. The comparison between the cost and conservation efforts between vertebrates and invertebrates is astounding given the magnitude&nbsp;of invertebrate impact on our ecosystems. &quot;The Big Things the Run the World&quot; seeks not to dispute the previous claims, but to provide a counter argument in support of large vertebrate research. Dr. Terborgh claims that these animals have a stabilizing effect on the communities they inhabit, that cascade down through multiple trophic levels. He provides an example of this by exploring how the absence of top predators from certain ecosystems could lead to a greater number of seed predators, thus a lower tree density, which would continue to cascade down to the species that rely on tree cover for habitat and other resources. His main argument suggests that since population densities are lower due to the typically K-selected nature of these species, researchers are less willing to put in the heavy effort needed to study them and are less likely to receive funding for such an undertaking. Both authors make common sense arguments for the best devotion of resources, we can only hope that both visions will be realized.&lt;/p&gt;

In &quot;The Little Things that Run the World&quot; the author makes very valid points about how invertebrates are essential to the entire ecosystem. In &quot;The Big Things that Run the World&quot; the author argues that it is essential the big organisms that run the ecosystem. So which is it? Which is more important, bottom-up or top down control? In my personal opinion, I believe that bottom-up control is more important. In the first article, the author makes a great point that if humans were to disappear from the earth, it would thrive. However, if invertebrates were to disappear, the entire ecosystem would crumble. Invertebrates are our pollinators, and they do more for the ecosystem than perhaps we&#039;ll ever know. While the &quot;big things&quot; are important too, such as in the simutext when the wolves were reintroduced in Isle Royale to get the moose population under control, big things seem to have less of an effect. I feel as though the disappearance of big things can definitely have a substantial effect, but invertebrates are what the entire foundation is built upon. There&#039;s a reason why &quot;Save the Bees&quot; has been such a big movement over the past few years. How will our crops survive without the bees.

While I think most people are aware that there is a larger amount of invertebrates on the planet than vertebrates, this article really puts in perspective just how massive their biomass is. They also construct so much of the world around us, from building coral reefs to eat dead plant debris in the forest. Invertebrates are undeniably&nbsp;a major part of our planets ecosystem, but how do they compare to the importance of larger animals? &quot;The Big Things That Run the World&quot; talks about how due to their lower relative biomass and difficulty to study, larger mammals are often dismissed in conversations about&nbsp;ecological relationships. As top predators, they indirectly control all trophic levels from the top down, which seems just as important.

Wilson paints a picture of bottom up control through the existence of invertebrates. Wilson stresses that life on the entire planet is essentially built upon invertebrates and their effect on all species in the trophic levels above them. Wilson even states that 90% of the planet&#039;s&nbsp;biodiversity comes&nbsp;from invertebrates; I&nbsp;found this surprising at first, as I simply had just never thought of invertebrates as such a foundational part of the planet&#039;s ecosystem, but as I thought about it, it&#039;s actually not surprising at all considering the sheer amount of species containing invertebrates and how basically every place on earth has some form of invertebrates present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second article, &quot;The Big Things that Run The World,&quot; by John Terborgh&nbsp;provides practically the opposite outlook;&nbsp;a top down control oriented view where he states that large animals, predators, are the controlling force in food chains across the world. Terborgh makes it clear through his writing that he believes that large animals have the greatest influence on ecosystem stability and maintaining biodiversity in ecosystems. it doesn&#039;t surprise me that Terborgh believes that large animals (predators) would have the most dramatic effect on ecosystems across the globe because of their more obvious presence and effect on the ecosystem, but I think that more attention has been&nbsp;paid to larger animals than smaller ones (like Wilson&#039;s invertebrates) in the study of ecosystems. I support Wilson&#039;s proposal more so than Terborgh, I believe that if smaller organisms, the base of food chains, were to be removed, the whole food chain would fall apart much quicker and more drastically than if the predator of the food chain were removed.&lt;/p&gt;

Reading about the importance of conservation of invertebrates was very interesting as well as the fact that if we fail to conserve invertebrates and a major decline occurs,&nbsp;the collapse of human survival would likely occur. Similarly, when reading Terborgh&rsquo;s (1988) &ldquo;The Big Things That Run the World&rdquo;, I was surprised to find out the not only is the conservation of &ldquo;big things&rdquo; of great importance, it may be of even greater importance than the conservation of &ldquo;little things&rdquo; such as invertebrates due to their increased vulnerability in our adapting world. Further, I was intrigued by the &ldquo;erosion of diversity&rdquo; that would occur on numerous levels of our ecosystem if the proper upkeep of &ldquo;big things&rdquo; were not properly regulated. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Just the sheer size of them alone was hard to imagine, but once you understand how much more invertebrates there are than vertebrates it is easy to see why they are so important. Without these invertebrates we would not be where we are today, some of them are definitely the backbones of their communities. Take the leaf-cutter ants for an example, a single colony of them is roughly two million. Humans have spent so long getting an inventory of vertebrates, probably because they are so big and we assume they are the most important part of an ecosystem, but they have overlooked the small invertebrates of the world. Humans still do not have an inventory of invertebrates, there are more than 200,000 species of just beetles alone. I assume that the variety of species is so much more than vertebrates because they have smaller life spans and reproduce faster. In conclusion, this paper has provided a better understanding of how important the invertebrates are and how overlooked they can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to this paper,&nbsp;&quot;The Big things that run the world&quot; by John Terborgh states that it&#039;s the big animals in the ecosystems that are the keystone species and most important. While he does acknowledge the contributions the invertebrates have, he thinks that the vertebrates are the main reason for the ecosystems and humans fail to recognize their importance. While it is important to have these big animals, having both is what makes an ecosystem thrive. They both play a huge role in where they are, some might have a larger role depending on the location but overall they both deserve recognition and study.&lt;/p&gt;

The bring all the resources up to the top with them and when they die they return their resources to the lower levels. I believe that looking at these organisms can allow us to view how each organism in the chain is doing.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

699377,19340,22725,33932,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;I found E.O Wilsons essay interesting because I previously did not know how much diversity there was in invertibrates or how much they affected the ecosystem. For example, I thought it was cool that a colony of&nbsp;leaf cutter ants can collect &quot;about 50 kilograms of fresh vegetation&quot; per day because thats a lot of mass. This also is interesting because it means that the ants play a pretty big role in moving energy up the trophic cascade. As for Terourgh&#039;s article, I thought it was interesting the ways he mentioned predators can affect the ecosystem. I previously didn&#039;t think about how when predators kill certain prey then the trees that the prey eat will flourish which can change the diversity of tress or other plants in an ecosystem.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

It is interesting to see two almost opposites views on something, yet they also share many similarities. It was quite a turn around from reading the first article and being informed on how impactful and important &quot;little things&quot; are to our world and functioning ecosystem to then go on to read the second article which highlights the importance of &quot;big things&quot; and how it impacts our world. I really like your statement on how it does not surprise you that Terborgh believes larger animals are more impactful because of their size and more obvious presence as well as your opinion that bigger animals have had more of a focus on then versus smaller when it comes to research. While I believe Terborgh bings up some very important points, I think I will have to agree with you in your preference for Wilson&#039;s proposal.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

699381,19340,22725,33947,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;The article about the little things immediately screams &quot;underdog&quot; to me. I stop and think about just how many decomposers and other invertebrates live in the soil I walk past every day, and how all of those organisms are keeping my front yard looking nice or even allowing the forest next to my house to grow. I think the entirety of nature is built on the small things because nature started out small. The first forms of life were small and very unassuming, and many organisms found this role fitting and desired not to change. The ones that got big only did so because they had a plethora of small organisms to take resources from and sustain a big lifestyle with. The article about big things instantly reminded me of dinosaurs. Containing groups that hold records for being the largest land animals to have ever existed, dinosaurs shaped their environment through their everyday activities on a scale we can&#039;t even imagine with today&#039;s animal standards. Edmontosaurus was an herbivorous dinosaur&nbsp;that measured 39 feet in length and weighed around 6 tons, and there is fossil evidence that they traveled in herds. Just imagine the amount of plant matter they would have to consume in one day to stay alive, and how all of that grazing would drastically alter landscapes. Little or big, ecosystems exist in such fragile balances between all sizes of animals that fulfull all sorts of niches, and that&#039;s just crazy cool.&lt;/p&gt;

I also thought that it was disappointing to hear that larger animals are more ignored then the smaller species.

699385,19340,22725,33947,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;Yeah I definitely see how bigger animals as keystone species can make or break an environment. I think it all comes down to how an ecosystem is structured, with some naturally containing more plant and small animal life like ponds and others containing plenty of big animals and not much else like the African savannah. It&#039;s like there are two different worlds at play and both definitely have their place in ecology.&lt;/p&gt;

If you have no big animals, then little ones get out of control, but if you don&#039;t have small animals, you can&#039;t have an ecosystem in the first place. I also think it&#039;s cool that nature has worked out the niches so that everything consumes something in a very orderly way, and size plays a big role in what role a species plays.&lt;/p&gt;

699390,19340,22725,34098,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;I thought the article &ldquo;The Little Things That Run the World&rdquo; was very interesting but not surprising. When I actually thought about it, it makes sense that invertebrates make up so much of The Earth&#039;s population due to their abundant population sizes which leads to invertebrates having a greater combined body mass. What was more shocking was to find out how dependent we as humans are on invertebrate species in order to survive. which once again makes sense when we think about the science behind it. And while I do agree that invertebrates are absolutely 100% necessary to sustain any food web or food chain I feel as though The article &ldquo;The Big Things that Run The World&rdquo; had a good point that species at the top of the food chain also play&nbsp; an important part in maintaining the food chain. However I would argue that every interaction in the food chain is important because the process is like top down and bottom up processing. If you remove anything from a food web it will undoubtedly have an impact on other species and the main difference is just the amount of impact.&lt;/p&gt;

699391,19340,22725,33944,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;In the first article it was interesting to learn that we need invertebrates, but they don&#039;t need us. However, if invertebrates were to disappear, we may not last more than a couple months. This article has helped me understand the true purpose of many insects as I have often wondered why they even exist. Since invertebrate conservation is relatively inexpensive, I do not see why it isn&#039;t more known to individuals and would be interested in learning more about this topic. In the second article, they mention big mammals such as elephants and jaguars are harder to capture making it more challenging to study them. They also mention a few highly productive prey species may determine the carrying capacity of the environment for large predators. If you remove the top predator and observe the demographic effects you can see that the succession of links describes the direct effects in the system. This article has taught me that big things are also important and may even be more vulnerable in some scenarios. The balance of both big and small things living together in an ecosystem is needed to maintain homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

699477,19340,22725,34135,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;Upon reading &quot;The Little Things that Run the World,&quot; Edward O. Wilson shed some&nbsp;light on the importance of invertebrates in our ecosystems. While reading this article, I could not help but make the comparison of bees also being a vital part of our ecosystem and how the world would collapse without their role. I also noticed the lack of classification for invertebrates while we readily classify and archive vertebrates and their niches in society. Their functions that are highly vital to maintaining our ecosystems reminds me of a talking point we had in class called the Bottom-Up Hypothesis; the entire ecosystem would collapse if these invertebrates were to be removed or go extinct.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article titled &quot;The Big Things That Run The World&quot; has a completely different approach. John Terborgh strains that larger animals that are not accounted for and documented by ecologists is what decides the fate of their entire ecosystem. Evidence to support his statement would point towards the fact that a predators ability to capture prey would indirectly and directly affect the population size of neighboring populations, and thus change the biodiversity of the ecosystem accordingly. This argument reminds me of another talking point we had in class like the Top-Down Hypothesis and those intricate food webs.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

HOWEVER, everything would completely collapse very fast without invertebrates. No plant&nbsp;that requires pollinators would reproduce. (Only plants that are wind pollinated would do okay).

I was able to draw connections between these two articles and top-down versus bottom-up control. The Little Things that Run the World made a case for a more bottom-up method of control where the little things at the bottom of the trophic levels. The Big Things that Run the World made a case for a top-down control where the big things, the larger animals higher up in the trophic levels have a stronger pull. I don&rsquo;t find these articles to be contradictory to each other, rather they give arguments for the importance of all sizes of organisms, with particular importance to those at the top and bottom. I think both of these articles raise points as to a bias in opinions based on the ability to study the organisms.
