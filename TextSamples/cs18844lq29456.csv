&lt;p&gt;This is a panoramic image containing supernumerary teeth. Supernumerary teeth are teeth that develop that are atypical to the traditional 32 teeth. Seen commonly in Hispanic populations, supernumerary teeth need either to be extracted or adjusted with orthodontic treatment depending on their location. They can cause extreme discomfort to the patient as they erupt outside of the occlusal plane. Complications may arise if they erupt in a way that may disrupt the roots of the 32 typical teeth, which is why many complicated cases are referred to oral surgeons.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

655502,18844,29456,33119,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;For this case, the most ideal solution would be complete dentures, but let&#039;s talk about how miraculous it would be to see this case to completion.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step one: most of these teeth are non-restorable. Most of these teeth are probably only supported by soft tissue or possibly calculus. Keeping them in the mouth poses a systematic issue to their health. Full mouth extraction is non-negotiable.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step two: How to replace them is where things get tricky. The mandible has a better diagnosis than the maxilla in my opinion. We&#039;re playing the &quot;how much bone&quot; game at this point. The mandible has an excellent amount of residual bone structure remaining making this patient a great candidate for an all-on-four case (if reasonably affordable). Removable lowers are a pain for the doctor and the patient, so if finances are an issue and we need to pick an arch to invest in, this is the one. If necessary, it could be done, but fingers crossed for an implant-supported denture being reasonable for this patient. I&#039;d place full-sized implants at the former site of the canines and the first molars for ideal pressure tolerance during mastication. The patient is always at risk of nerve damage in this area, but the IAN seems to be reasonably low on this patient making this not a huge concern for me.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step three: The maxilla is a completely different story. The maxillary sinuses have pneumatized incredibly. The remaining bone there is little to nothing. If possible, I&#039;d examine their CBCT to see if there is a chance of supporting these via zygomatic implants, but I would let the patient know that this is an incredibly guarded prognosis of success. This is assuming that I&#039;m a veteran oral surgeon. Frankly, a removable denture would probably be safer, but the patient would live a life of having it constantly adjusted as their bone level is going to get worse over time. They&#039;re not a good candidate for snap-in dentures (not that those are my favorites anyway) due to how advanced their case is.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a case this severe is just heartbreaking. For the patient behind this x-ray, I hope they are doing well and have a master dentist overseeing their case.&lt;/p&gt;

655510,18844,29456,33119,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;This tooth&#039;s distal root is experiencing a fraction that has created bone loss at the furcation and below. This can be said with confidence as the distal root has unusual radiolucency near the cementoenamel junction, and the radiolucency at the furcation site has a J shape. This happens either due to bruxism, a failed RCT, a retreatment of an RCT that was already brittle, or just age. The suggested tx plan is EXT with bone removal, bone grafting, and implant-supported crown. If unable, I still would suggest replacing this tooth in general as #30 is a first molar, and I would like to avoid the mesial drift of #31. It already has a large filling, and its shifting would put it at a higher risk of an accelerated progression further down the tooth death spiral.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
