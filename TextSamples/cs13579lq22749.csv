405986,13579,22749,20995,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;The substitution of Br onto the bridgehead involves the formation of a radical at the bridgeheads. Radicals typically prefer an sp2 planar geometry.

&lt;p&gt;In the Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, the radical intermediate is possible, because the two rings have two more carbons and therefore they are more flexible which will let the bridgehead go through a planar conformation to form an sp2 hybridized radical intermediate in order to undergo the substitution.&lt;/p&gt;

This is possible because the intermediate has a ring with two more carbons than bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.

406275,13579,22749,21342,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;I think that perhaps the intermediate carbon radical cannot form. When the halide radical abstract a hydrogen from a carbon, it leaves a carbon radical which is sp2 hybridized. I think that because bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane allows for a planar sp2 hybridization to form, while the&nbsp;bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane does not. I think this is because the 8 carbon ring is large enough for the bridging carbon to fit within the ring, thus allowing for the planar sp2 hybridization to form temporarily and for the radical carbon to be brominated. With the&nbsp;bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, the six carbon ring is not large enough for the bridging carbon to fit within it. Thus, the carbon is stuck in its tetrahedral shape and it will not reacti with the bromine radical. (This is just a theory)&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, carbonium ions are more easily formed&nbsp;at bridgehead positions when a structure&nbsp;can have a planar-like geometry&nbsp;at that position. This is rather achieved in larger ring systems as is observed in the case of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. If such geometric conditions are not met, then the energy will increase and the compound will become less stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, due to the bigger ring structure in reaction A, planar-like geometry at the bridgehead position can be obtained and the product of the reaction is more stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at those two structures, I would suggest that there is some kind of strain that forms. If we look at the 1-bromobicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, we can see that there is no strain, and thus the Br atom is quite stable in this position. However, there is more strain when it comes to bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Strain means unstability, and as we know, chemistry does not like unstable things. Br will prefer to attack a different carbon that is more stable if it means that the bond will be more stable.&lt;/p&gt;

406854,13579,22749,22353,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;Through radical halogenation, in the presence of light, Br2 will dissociate to form halide radicals. The halide radical can then abstract a hydrogen atom from the alkane, leaving behind a carbon radical. Hypothetically, this will occur at the bridgeheads of these molecules because they are 3˚ carbons, this will form the most stable radical through&nbsp;hyperconjugation. The carbon radical then attacks Br2 and forms a C-Br sigma bond. For this to occur the carbon atom must be sp2 and planar. When&nbsp;bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (B)&nbsp;is treated with Br2 under irradiation, no substitution takes place at the bridgehead because the ring is rigid and cannot become planar. However, A is a larger molecule and has more flexibility so it can become planar at the bridgehead so substitution is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

For B, It would be more stable for the bridge to break and form a double bond with the methyl group the bridge is attached two as the geometry of the structure of B is not suffice for hyper conjugation. While structure A has both more carbons and a ringed structure which greatly increase the stability of a radical, allowing Br to be able to be added.&lt;/p&gt;

406869,13579,22749,20996,NULL,NULL,"&lt;p&gt;This is because in scenario A, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane has two more carbons than bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane which allows it to be much more flexible and undergo planar intermediate conformations and form the sp2 hybridized radical needed to produce the product at the bridgehead 100%, whereas in scenario B, the ring is not as flexible, preventing it from becoming planar, making sp2 hybridization impossible, and thus the reaction cannot proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
