&lt;p&gt;1) Titana&#039;s&nbsp;hair is made up of titanium. Titanium is a metal high in strength, her hair has the ability to hit, cut and fight people i.e. choke them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) With the snap of her fingers, Titana&nbsp;can create a fire with her titanium hands. By snapping them, it causes titanium dust which is easily flammable. To put out the flames she must put on fire-resistant gloves which contain sodium chloride powder. This sodium chloride powder (salt) does not let the&nbsp;fire come into contact with any air.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) On Titana&#039;s&nbsp;anatomy, there are metal titanium plates, using her flammable hands, the plates can stretch and protect her due to titanium being ductile. For her titanium to stretch she needs above room temperature heat.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Due to titaniums flammability, Titana&nbsp;has a very volatile personality which tends to make people not want to be around her. Also because her hair is long, strong and sharp, she ends up cutting/hurting people around her accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, Iodite has purple hair; when she uses her super power, she can blend in and not be recognised by others around her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavior&lt;/strong&gt; property: Due to the strong and unpleasant smell of solid iodine from the costume she wears, that has impregnated in her skin, Iodite tends to stay away from others when at work and to spend most of her time alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super power&lt;/strong&gt; property: Iodite has enhanced regenerative capabilities due to the large amount of iodine in her body; iodine works as a sterilizer for her to recover from outer wounds on her body. Also, her most lethal super power is her ability to create a purple toxic gas; when solid iodine is heated, it turns into a purple gas that is very harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APPEARANCE:&lt;/strong&gt; Brominella&rsquo;s &nbsp;hair, lips and eyes are her defining &nbsp;physical features. Her hair and lips are the same redish brown color as the liquid state of bromine. She wears a two-way mask to cover her eyes, she can see through but others can&rsquo;t see her. She hides her eyes because they are a distinctive amber color, the same color as the gas state of Bromine. Also, in ancient times, prior to the discovery of bromine, royalty would wear fabrics died with Tyrian purple , which is a bromine compound containing a natural dye. Hence why her costume is purple, an acknowledgment to the elements history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEHAVIOR:&lt;/strong&gt; She is somewhat of a recluse she stays to herself and rarely , if ever, goes out to social gatherings. She keeps away from situations that may cause other people to come into direct contact with her skin, because if touched it will burn them. This trait comes from the toxic nature of gas and liquid bromine. If exposed to skin, bromine can cause irritation and burns. This quality of hers also forces her to always wear gloves, long sleeves and pants during her regular life. This is also why her costume covers a large part of her neck and why her arms and legs are covered in a protective mesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUPER POWER ABILITY:&lt;/strong&gt; Brominella&rsquo;s main super power is her ability to either shift completely or partially into the gas state of bromine or even excrete it from her pours when necessary in smaller quantities. Bromine can evaporate very easily. Her ability allows her to irritate her victims&#039; skin and eyes, potentially blinding them momentarily, and even attack their respiratory system. In the picture, Brominella is partially transformed. That is why, in the drawing, her lower half is covered in an amber gas.Her secondary ability is that she is able to resistant and slow down flames. When certain materials are soaked in a bromine compound, it makes them flame retardant, hence Brominella&rsquo;s ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

He also has blue eyes and white hair as there are hints of blue and white present in the colour of aluminum. He also has thirteen freckles because that is the amount of electrons aluminum has which was obtained through his atomic&nbsp;number&nbsp;and has 13 electrons revolving around the nucleus. He is also skinny as he weighs 26.98kg (his atomic mass is 26.98). He also has an extremely thin layer of aluminum oxide around his body in order to protect him from corrosion.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviour Property: &lt;/strong&gt;Captain Al is very clumsy as he is highly reactive as he wants to lose his three electrons thus being clumsy as he is always losing electrons. He is highly reactive and clumsy when he reacts with acids, water and alkali&#039;s such as Sodium Hydroxide. He is also friendly as he forms lots of alloys with metals such as copper. He forms alloys to get stronger thus being able to make lots of friends and forming these friendships easily. These friendships make him a stronger person overall.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Power Property: &lt;/strong&gt;His main super power is he is able to transform his body into thin&nbsp;sheets which will allow him to fit into extremely small spaces that a person usually cannot fit in. This occurs&nbsp;as aluminum is highly ductile (able to be beaten into extremely thins sheets). Once he fits into the tiny spaces, his body regains its normal form. His second super power is that he is able to transform his armor from a dull silver to a shiny silver as aluminum is shiny. This allows him to blind his enemies temporarily for 10&nbsp;seconds and this allows him battle his enemy with worrying about sustaining damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I really can&#039;t draw to save my life sorry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance&lt;/strong&gt;: Armour is a silver/grey colour because potassium exists as such and turns into a dull grey when exposed to oxygen. The lilac colour on her appearance represents the potassium when it is reacting with water which she uses to her advantage. Potassium can be easily cut with a knife or scalpel which is why she wears a belt &ndash; this belt, with the push of the button in the center, acts as a force field to protect her from her enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviour: &lt;/strong&gt;Due to its reputation in the food industry as a healthy substance, she is able to be trusted by those around her and is able to mingle in society. She does, however, have to be quite careful because the melting point of potassium is quite low (63.5 degrees Celsius) that the heat from a candle could melt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Villain Ability: &lt;/strong&gt;The bracelets on her wrists contain water which she can easily access in order to create flames. The hydrogen within the water reacts violently with the potassium and creates a lilac flame which could potentially explode. She uses this reaction to wreak havoc amongst the town and is very destructive when left to her own devices. She sets fires within the towns and then the gases which contain potassium released from the fire get into the people&rsquo;s bloodstream which can be harmful to a person and potentially life threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

His armour is of a yellowish tone which ironically represents the natural appearance of the element. Skeletium carries a bow and arrows that are made out of his own bones. He also has a pet naked mole-rat, as the animal is immune to cancer and thus, can always be by his side.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skeletium is a&nbsp;nice guy, but he is extremely short-tempered. He is known for overreacting to pretty much everything. On the other hand,&nbsp;he&nbsp;is very charitable and is often seen in hospitals curing patients. He never refuses to give a hand to anybody but he makes it clear that he does not want to receive anything in return. When fighting criminals, Skeletium is ruthless. Due to the properties of his main weapon, 90Sr, (and his temper) his interventions are often quite cruel and have caused numerous controversies. Deep-inside, he despises all humans, as he is often criticized for his actions and also for the fact that most people stay far away from him, fearing that they will be contaminated. His only true friend is his pet mole-rat, which&nbsp;helps him calm down when he is frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Naked mole-rats can very rarely suffer from the disease, but are usually deemed as immune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name of my character: Lucidum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Property 1 : Appearance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucidum is a shiny solid and has some grey areas on its body, just like arsenic, who&#039;s stable form is silver/gray, brittle and solid.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arsenic does not melt when it&#039;s heated, it actually goes through sublimation (solid to gas), which is why I made the hair of Lucidum look like a flame, and not flat against her back. I left some parts of it white because the gas produced after sublimation can be seen as a white cloud (hence the white parts).&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around her waist, is 33 little balls, representing the 33 protons or the atomic number of arsenic (As).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Property 2 : Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucidum is the contrary of solitary. Because of her very shiny body, it attracts a lot of people. People are quite confused, because most of the time they think of Arsenic as poison, so when they see how odorless and shiny it looks, they let their guards down.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Property 3 : Superpower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of its superpowers is that Lucidum is very poisonous and toxic, just like arsenic (As) and its compounds (which was commonly known as the King of poison). Indeed, being exposed for a too long period of time to it could give you cancer, brain conditions, and cause many other effects. Lucidum uses its shininess and physique&nbsp;to attract people and then expose&nbsp;them to her toxicity.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Calcium exposed to oxygen creates a brick red flame, so his hair is like a bright red flame. He also has really shiny teeth that are almost blinding. Since calcium reacts to oxygen like a bright fire, when his teeth are exposed, his teeth shine super brightly.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavior:&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;He is really energetic and moves a lot. Calcium exposed to oxygen creates a brick of fire, and fire is always in motion, so he is also always in motion. But exposed to water, he becomes gloomy and sad. Calcium reacts very slowly to water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superpower: He can create fire. With oxygen everywhere, he can create fire when he wants anywhere he wants. His fire can also blind for a second, because the second the fire is formed, there is a bright light. His bones are also his weapons. Calcium strengthen bones so all of his bones can be used as weapons such as swords and shields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviour:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She hates to be alone and always seeks to bond with someone else. She often sticks close to members of her own family (hydrogen is diatomic), but can also make friends with others quite easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Power:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has fire powers because hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Since she is hard to detect she can easily enter her enemies&rsquo; hideouts and lairs unseen and burn them down. She also has the ability to create a massive nuclear explosion (H-bomb), however, this power can only be used once as it would cost her her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appearance: Carat&#039;s shiny golden hair and suit match the color of gold in it&#039;s solid form. Gold is also seen as a very valuable material, that is often a symbol of wealth. As such, Carat dresses like someone who is living a very wealthy life style. He has an over the top golden suit, with nice shoes and many rings on his hands. It also matches his day job, which is as a profitable business man.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavior: Despite his attention grabbing appearance, Carat is someone who prefers to be alone and work alone, he only lets few into his personal life. This is based on the fact that gold is a practically non reactive substance, only reacting with halogens and a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acid, know as aqua regia. Yet, to the public, he has an air of grandeur and acts as though he is an extremely important person, once again going off how gold is viewed by modern society,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super Power: Gold is known to be the most malleable and ductile of metals, so Carat&#039;s power directly reflects that. With more gold in his body than the average human, Carat is capable of making his body incredibly flat and stretching it out to great lengths. He uses this power to get into places that people normally would not be allowed into. He most often uses this power to rob from banks and add onto his existing wealth. His only real weakness is, like the chemical gold, he is very soft and a well placed bullet or stab through his body could be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superpower properties&lt;/strong&gt;: The Mad Merc&rsquo;s super villain powers are to be able to shape shift into a liquid mental, or solidify into an object. At standard room temperature and pressure mercury becomes a liquid. Melting/freezing point is around -40 degrees Celsius. He is able to duplicate himself as he can become a liquid which benefits him during battle. When in a non-metallic form The Mad Merc is able to shot poisonous mercury gas rays from his eyes. This is possible due to the rays heating up the mercury in his system which is already in a liquid form and turns it into mercury gas which is extremely toxic when inhaled and can cause death. Boiling point is approximately 360 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviour properties:&lt;/strong&gt; The Mad Merc is typically a loner due to his extremely heavy density which is approximately 5.427g/cm which tends to shake or vibrate the objects around him while he walks giving an intimidating characteristic which scares people away. The Mad Merc tends to be more on the cold side due to the fact that mercury is a poor conductor of heat which makes him almost unapproachable. In addition, the Mad Merc when in contact with others can send little electrical shocks to the other individuals because mercury is a very good conductor of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance properties:&lt;/strong&gt; The Mad Merc&rsquo;s skin is not made out of tissue rather it is composed of malleable metal substance. This is due to the fact that Mad Merc&rsquo;s body is inorganic meaning he does not consist of living matter. This contributes to his exterior body being the shiny colour of silver when he is in any form. The Mad Merc&rsquo;s body colour is also based on mercury being known as quicksilver which is seen with its former name being &ldquo;hydragyrum&rdquo; which refers to the Greek words &ldquo;hydro&rdquo; meaning water and &ldquo;argyros&rdquo; meaning sliver. &nbsp;Mercury can be found most commonly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red pigment vermilion is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide. The Mad Merc&rsquo;s eye colour would be red due to the presences of mercury sulfide dust that was blown into his eyes, completely deforming them to be all red. There is also the presence of mercury sulfide in his belt. The Mad Merc doesn&rsquo;t need a custom as he is turning from an extremely hard solid which is when he appears more bulky (rock like appearance), to a liquid which is when he is a substance which can take any form. The one article he wears is his temperature regulating belt which allows him to decide which phase (solid or liquid) he wants to take the form of by pushing on of the two buttons by raising or lowering the heat. Underneath the logo Mad Merc is the number 80 which represent the atomic number of mercury.&lt;/p&gt;

Fluorine is the most electronegative element, this means, in molecules fluorine attracts electrons more powerfully than any other element can. It&rsquo;s the most reactive of all the elements. Unfortunately not many people like speaking to Fluorider because of his pungent odor, fluorine has a very strong distasteful smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluorider is able to exhale a smelly and highly corrosive gas, because Fluorine is a corrosive gas with a pungent smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluorider wears gloves made of sodium, because when Fluorider releases his fluorine it reacts with the sodium violently and combusts, it creates a small explosion.&lt;/p&gt;

For obvious reasons, he will use the hardness property of the diamond to deal with enemies. For example, he can change the shape of his diamond fist into a sharp object.

&lt;p&gt;Appearance:&lt;br /&gt;
Her hair is magenta due to the presence of Cesium in her body. Cesium, when exposed to the air, self ignites and the flame is a magenta colour which accounts for the colour of her hair. One of her eyes is also the gold colour of Cesium. Her outfit is completely flame retardant to accommodate her powers and Cesium&#039;s extreme reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behaviour:&lt;br /&gt;
She is nice enough until you get on her bad side.

&lt;p&gt;Super Powers:&lt;br /&gt;
She has a couple different abilities from the Cesium. Firstly, her left hand is made of solid Cesium. Normally, she has to wear a special glove to cover it and keep all other elements away from it. However, when in combat she removes the glove and the Cesium self-ignites. She has control over this flame and can direct it at her enemies. Her second ability comes into play when an opponent attacks with blades. Any blood that they manage to draw contains Cesium and if it gets on them, it will react with the oxygen around them and burn the opponent alive.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has yellow-green hair and eyes, representing the colour of chlorine in its gaseous state. She also wears an amber-coloured bodysuit, representing the colour of chlorine in its liquid state.&nbsp;Her bodysuit, gloves and boots are all made of shiny rubber. The rubber is shiny because it&#039;s been chlorinated, in other words, it&#039;s been treated with a chlorine solution.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviour:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady Chloros is a clean freak. She hates germs and bacteria and she goes out of her way to clean surfaces before coming into contact with them, mimicking the disinfecting property of hypochlorous acid (HClO). She loves wearing chlorinated rubber because another benefit of having rubber treated with chlorine is that it also makes the rubber resistant to staining. Lady Chloros detests stains because it makes her feel dirty.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superpower:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady Chloros is able to, on command, breathe out chlorine gas. She can also control where the gas goes. Her preferred method is to send the gas to her opponent&#039;s lungs, thus making her opponent have a hard time breathing. As they lay on the ground choking, she then knocks them out. When chlorine gas comes into contact with the moist tissues in the lungs, an acid is produced and it damages the tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Her suit is silver since it is made out of &nbsp;rubidium and &nbsp;is described as being that colour and since it is an element that melts very easily her suit can heat itself up to the melting point of 39 degrees Celsius and mold her weapon of choice that will then solidify as room temperature,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Rubidium is highly toxic therefor as a super villain she seduces her victims to then poison them by once again heating her rubidium bracelet (you cant see in the picture)&nbsp;and then poisoning her victim while in it&#039;s liquid form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Her skin is the colour purple since rubidium can be found in space (also why she has stars and a moon over her eyebrow) and when used in fireworks it turns them&nbsp;purple colour.&lt;/p&gt;

He has a gun and a jet pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEHAVIOR: &lt;/strong&gt;Sulshot is very attractive because of his bright yellow crystal skin at room temperature which the ladies love. He&#039;s very friendly with hydrogen as well. He tends to stay in volcanic areas because that is where sulfur is most abundant. He also helps nature because sulfur is essential to all living things (soil, algues and plants).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUPER POWER:&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;His main power is that he is able to vulcanize rubber and polymers on the spot and make them more durable materials to create weapons and armor. He also can make gunpowder which sulfate is one of the main components. He uses this power to create the weapons he needs to kill villains and also help citizen when in need of materials such as rubber.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance:&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Phosphorella&nbsp;has white hands and white eyes due to the colour of white phosphorus. Also, the shape of her hands and eyes are in a tetrahedral shape, the shape of white phosphorus. She can shoot fire with her eyes and hands, therefore she always wears special glasses and special gloves. She wears a yellow costume that prevents her from burning alive and&nbsp;has yellow hair due to the traces of red phosphorous left as an impurity. When exposed to air, Phosphorella glows (process called chemiluminescence). The glowing is caused by cold chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviour:&lt;/strong&gt; White phosphorus is a poisonous solid. Hence, she does not go out often and tends to avoid any interactions with humans because if she comes in contact with skin, she could cause serious burns to it. She can cause eye and respiratory irritations when she is exposed to humans for too long. &nbsp;Hence, she is always alone. When she does go out, she is in the red phosphorous form. However, she rarely leaves the house since it is difficult for her to transform to red phosphorous (need to be heated with a catalyst to 240&deg;C). In red phosphorus form, she is non-toxic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Power:&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;When exposed to air Phosphorella can shoot fires with a simple look and/or gesture (generates heat). Phosphorus reacts with the oxygen very quickly and creates fire. She can also control the flames. She is also super toxic to any hero or villain that has human skin, because she burns skin.&lt;/p&gt;

Like silver, his good looks literally shine.&nbsp;He dyes&nbsp;his hair silver/gray and wears a white scarf (an&nbsp;ineffective&nbsp;attempt to hide his identity) to reflect the appearance of Ag. For fashion reasons, he does not wear a superhero suit or armour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviou&lt;/strong&gt;r: Silver has a very high electrical conductivity, and so, small simple things are&nbsp;able to spark the Silver Shooter&#039;s anger/annoyance.&nbsp;This explains his trigger-happy behaviour. Being a hot-heated individual also&nbsp;ties in with silver&#039;s thermal conductivity.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superpower&lt;/strong&gt;: The Silver Shooter&#039;s hands are made of silver. Characterized as a soft and malleable metal, his hands can change form. The Silver Shooter&#039;s go-to attack is&nbsp;to transform his finger into a gun barrel and shoot silver bullets. It is possible for him to change his hands into, for example, a dagger or even cutlery. But course, the Silver Shooter sticks to his guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrumina&rsquo;s suit is lustrous silver because fresh iron appears that colour before it oxidizes. Iron is naturally magnetic so her black boots are also magnetic. On her pants, there is an upside down triangle with the number 26 which is the atomic number of iron. Her belt is made out of steel and can also be used as a weapon. This element is used the production of fireworks. Her hair is red and can produce sparks as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behaviour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrumina&rsquo;s hair produces sparks and she cannot control it especially when she is exposed to heat. She uses it to scare her opponents whenever she can. However, when her hair starts to spark during random moments, it scares everyone away. This explains why she doesn&rsquo;t really have many friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superpower:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since pure iron is soft and malleable, Ferrumina&rsquo;s super power is that she can form herself into any for and shape she wants. She can squeeze into tiny spaces to defeat her opponents as well as bend her body to avoid getting hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in a solid state, oxygen has a light blue color while also being clear which is why the body and the glasses of Yang are blue. His name is Yang because yang means oxygen in Chinese which is the origin of my hero. His head is floating and not visible, just like oxygen which is a gas that floats and is not visible. His hands also float like oxygen gas and they can extend and move around far, just like the gas molecules in oxygen that are in constant quick motion. His body is floating also because oxygen is a gas that floats and he is able to move at quick speeds, like his hands.&nbsp;His belt has 3 tiny versions of his head in the shape of &quot;O&quot; like the symbol for oxygen, there are 3 &quot;O&quot;&#039;s because of O1, O2, and O3. He has a large and abundant body because oxygen is the third most abundant element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavior:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang has a bubbly personality due to his bubble shape and he is very caring and loves all living things since oxygen is used by everybody in order to survive. He doesn&#039;t always enjoy conflict however when he needs to , he won&#039;t hesitate in using his gas molecules in oxygen to out-maneuver his foes and gain the upper hand, literally the upper hand since his hands can move quickly too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superpowers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His main superpowers are super quick speed which is due to the gas molecules that can move around a lot at quick speeds. His hands can move very quickly too and very far for the same reason as his super quick speed. He can release oxygen &quot;O&quot; from his belt in the form of O1, O2 and O3 to help deliver oxygen to places of need and these elements have cool glasses like him which allow him to see what the elements see and he can maneuver them to infiltrate, spy and get to hard to reach places with them.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her hands are going to have gloves on them, since she is always cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has the superpower to be able to handle fire without getting hurt, and works in an electrical engineering lab, since she can&rsquo;t get an electrical shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since she is always cold, Bismuthina lives a lonely life on her planet, and can&rsquo;t form relationships with other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, since bismuth is repulsed by magnetic fields, Bismuthina can levitate, and can repulse metals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her hair is made up of very thin copper wires that have begun to corrode which is why it ombre&#039;s into green at the ends (It gets greener as she ages). Her eyes have lightning bolts in them because she has electrical currents pulsing through her. She wears a rubber suit to contain her current and rubber gloves so she can&#039;t electrocute people&nbsp;by accident (she takes them off when she is fighting). She wears a copper belt so that she can whip it off and extend her current to enemies when she hits them.&lt;/p&gt;

It is vegan leather, because he is a vegan.&nbsp;However, on his back are gas tanks with the ability to change the atoms in air(N, O, H, and other gases) into Neon, by adding protons. From there, he has tubes he controls, through the use of the neon gas inside, to fight crime and help him fly. The tubes are no closed on the ends, so it is impossible to create a &#039;neon light&#039; effect, for aesthetic purposes, he put in LEDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEHAVIOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;As Neon is naturally a gas, and gasses spread around and fill up the space of their containers, so does Neno. He is a very talkative and open personality who tries to every person in the room at parties. This often gets in the way of his crime fighting, as his chatter distracts himself and often gets him beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn&rsquo;t have many friends, tries to stay away from people to avoid being killed or being captured. People want to kill him in order to sell his body because platinum is very expensive. Also, the government wants to stop him from curing cancer patients so they can make more money. Even though the government knows who he is and what he does, he tries to remain unknown to citizens. Usually shows up to hospitals at night and cures cancer patients while they&#039;re asleep.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superpower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platino&nbsp;can help people with cancer as platinum is often used in cancer treatments, has&nbsp;the ability to stretch out so get to places that are difficult to reach, and while stretched can protect people (like a shield) from fire or water as it has a high melting point and doesn&rsquo;t react with water or air. He must be careful though, because platinum can absorb a big amount of hydrogen gas, which could make him explosive.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Nitrogen triiodide is a form of explosive that is very sensitive, it can be detonated by the snap of a finger or the vibration of a footstep. The reaction between iodine and nitrogen is as follow: I + N = NI(small 3).&nbsp;To find nitrogen, Iodite will simply take any of her home cleaning furniture as they contain ammonia in it (ammonia contains a lot of nitrogen).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potassium Iodide:&lt;/strong&gt; When 1 atom of iodine reacts with 1 atom of potassium, it creates potassium iodide. Potassium iodide is a medication used to protect the immune system from radiation exposure. In a large quantity, potassium iodine is very dangerous, it can lead to allergic reactions, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, and swelling of specific glands in the body. The reaction between iodine and potassium is as follow: I + K = KI.&nbsp;Because potassium is so reactive, it is not present free in nature, Iodite will need to find minerals such as sylvite (KCl) in lakes (sylvite contain a lot of potassium).

This causes him to start burping so that he can get the Hydrogen gas released from his body. As a result, he will turn his attention toward releasing the hydrogen gas from his body so he will be easy to attack. This reaction can destroy his protective oxide layer which is why he is focused on releasing this gas from his body.

When his protective oxide layer is damaged, he is exposed to attacks including water thus he will react with water. This reaction will decrease Captain Al&#039;s strength until another oxide layer is regenerated. His strength decreases because when aluminum reacts with water, it lowers the strength of the metal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easily reacts sometimes explosively with almost every known substance. Sets fire to glass, sand, people, rust and many more. It&#039;s so effective because it&#039;s a more powerful oxidizing agent than oxygen itself, able to rapidly oxidize things that would be considered impossible. When chlorine trifluoride comes in contact with air it reacts explosively, creates large amount of dangerous gasses (Hydrofluoric acid).&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Hydrofluoric acid&nbsp; HF&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hydrofluoric acid is a solution of hydrogen fluoride&nbsp;in water. If hydrofluoric acid comes into contact with your skin it doesn&#039;t hurt until a couple of hours later, starts destroying nerves, bones and can cause cardiac arrest if it gets into your blood stream it can cause cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

It creates a precipitate that can be filtered and then be used for various functions. Strontium hydroxide, on its own, is dangerous for humans, as it can cause severe irritations. Skeletium might use this property to fight criminals, but he might also use it to travel across the city. Through the use of drain cleaning solutions, he will be able to turn himself into strontium hydroxide powder and travel through the town&#039;s sewage system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chemical compound forms mercury (II) Chlorine which is a&nbsp;white crystalline solid which happens to be a laboratory reagent and a molecular compound. Mercuric chloride does not exists as a salt composed of discrete ions, but it is composed of linear triatomic molecules, which explains its tendency to sublime. when mercury reacts to chlorine it is an extremely toxic by inhalation and by ingestion, odorless, and colorless substance with a wide range of uses. In the crystal, each mercury atom is bonded to two close chloride ligands with Hg&mdash;Cl distance of 2.38 &Aring;. Mercuric chloride is obtained through the reaction of chlorine on mercury by adding hydrochloric acid to a hot concentrated solution of mercury (I) compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Mercury and cyanide Hg(CN)2&lt;/p&gt;

It has a melting point of 320&deg;C which is when it begins to decompose and releases toxic mercury fumes. When it starts to decomposes when exposed to light, it becomes darker in color. It is highly soluble in polar solvents such as water, alcohol and ammonia. It reacts vigorously with oxidizing agents which can cause violent explosion. Low-level exposure can lead to fatigue, headaches, poor memory. whereas high-level exposure can lead to immediate collapse, loss of breath and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Mercury and sulfate HgO4S:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chemical compound forms mercury (II) sulfate, it is an odorless solid that forms white granules or crystalline powder. In water, it separates into an insoluble sulfate with a yellow color and sulfuric acid. &nbsp;Mercury sulfate, HgSO4, ca be produced by heating concentrated H2SO4 with elemental mercury: Hg + 2 H2SO4 &rarr; HgSO4 + SO2 + 2 H2O. Or by dissolving solid yellow mercuric oxide in concentrated sulfuric acid and water. It is soluble in hot sulfuric acid and sodium chloride solution. Insoluble in alcohol, acetone and ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- It is malleable, chemically reactive and electropositive. Its surface rapidly oxidizes in air, gaining a thin film. In dilute solutions, it dissolves rapidly to form Cm (III) solutions. Curium metal exists in two crystal structures: a double-hexagonal close-packed and a high temperature, face-centered cubic close-packed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&nbsp;If absorbed in to the body, curium accumulates in the bones. Its radiation destroys red blood cell formation. Consequently, curium is considered very toxic.&lt;/p&gt;

Carat keeps a can of chlorine gas in his office so, in a worst case scenario, he can inhale it and disappear into a powder, which one of his henchmen can heat up later to return him to his human form.&lt;/p&gt;

In my story, I plan for Carrat to face off against a new superhero team made up of heroes made of hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Gold and other Metals: Gold is an element that is generally unreactive, making it hard to find reactions to use in the story. Notably, it doesn&#039;t react chemically with most other metals either. The only way for anything to occur between gold and metals is to physically alloy them together. For example, gold and iron alloyed together will form Blue Gold. Gold, Copper and Silver can form pink gold. The alloyed metal is also, generally, much stronger than the two pure metals on their own, which is important, as gold is an incredibly soft metal. In my story, Carrat has many henchman, made from pure metals, like himself. When he&#039;s in a pinch, he can physically alloy himself to his henchmen to make himself stronger and not as soft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Cesium comes into contact with water, it creates an exothermic reaction. The Cesium hits the water and it reacts very quickly, creating what looks like a small explosion and a cloud of smoky vapor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cesium reacting&nbsp;with Fluorine:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cesium reacts strongly with all the halogens, like Fluorine for example. When Cesium and Fluorine come into contact, they react together and ignite. The flame creates an extremely bright, blinding light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possible chemical reaction can be with Fluorine. When Fluorine is present in the air,&nbsp;Tellus can react with it to form Tellurium Hexafluoride. He can inhale this gas causing the chemical reaction to occur inside his body. Then when the reaction is complete, he will begin burping to release this colourless gas. This gas smells so bad that when his enemy inhales it, they pass out because it is toxic when inhaled and has a terrible smell.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)Calcium reacts with carbonate: calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is most often found in caves as the forms of stalagmites(the ones that come from the ground). maybe your hero can have the ability to form stalagmites at a high speeds which can create a defense system (ex:a wall of stalagmites) in the case that he is being attacked from all sides.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)Tellurium reaction with air:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when tellurium is heated in air it combusts into a green/blue flame at a temperature of 340 degrees Celsius. Tellus uses this power to form balls of tellurium in his palm and make them automatically combust. this allows him to shot fireballs at his enemies which burn them severely.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Tellurium reacts with Chlorine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when tellurium reacts with chlorine it creates a solid known as tellurium tetrachloride.&nbsp;Te + 2 Cl2 &rarr; TeCl4. This solid is extremely toxic and therefore Tellus is able to use this. he forms this substance on his fists so when he has to fight in hand to hand combat he delivers toxic blows to his enemies. this leaves his enemies burned and blind if he hits them close in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Tellurium reacts with Sodium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tellurium reacts with sodium and forms a substance known as sodium telluride (Na2 Te). this substance is an extremely unstable acid. Tellus can use this acid to melt through any defences or any materials for entrance to wherever he desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;The Reaction of Aluminum with Hydrochloric Acid:&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Captain Al will react with diluted hydrochloric acid. If he drinks water that contains hydrochloric acid in it, hydrogen gas will be produced inside his stomach. This causes him to start burping so that he can get the Hydrogen gas released from his body. As a result, he will turn his attention toward releasing the hydrogen gas from his body so he will be easy to attack. This reaction can destroy his protective oxide layer which is why he is focused on releasing this gas from his body. The chemical formula for this reaction is as follows: 2Al(solid) + 6HCl(aqueous) ----&amp;gt; 2AlCl3(aqueous)&nbsp;+ 3H2 (gas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;The Reaction of Aluminum with Water:&lt;/strong&gt;Aluminum reacts with water. When his protective oxide layer is damaged, he is exposed to attacks including water thus he will react with water. This reaction will decrease Captain Al&#039;s strength until another oxide layer is regenerated. His strength decreases because when aluminum reacts with water, it lowers the strength of the metal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. T&lt;strong&gt;he Reaction of Aluminum with Oxygen:&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;When Captain Al lowers his oxide layer in order to manipulate electricity or when his oxide layer is damaged, he will react with oxygen. This reaction will cause him to begin the corrosion process. As a result, his movements will slow down as well as his attacks thus his strikes will be ineffective as the enemy can block his attacks since they are slow.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;The reaction of Aluminum and Iodine:&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Captain Al likes to carry aluminum powder with him in case of an emergency. This powdered Aluminum will react with Iodine. When he the powder comes into contact with iodine, he will add water to catalyse this reaction. As a result, this reaction produces a cloud of purple vapour/smoke thus allowing him to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Reaction of Aluminum with Nitric Acid: When Captain Al comes into contact with nitric acid, it will react with it.
